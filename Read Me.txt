Mini Hexacopter

Spider FPV mini hexacopter designed by Clayton Harp (aka gearwolf)

This was supposed to be a fun 5" mini hexacopter cabable of carrying even a gopro.  It was primarily meant as a racer with it's low profile and internal hardware.  Coupled with tiger 2300kv motors on a 3s this thing flies really good.  Never tried a 4s though.  It also uses all 36mm x 36mm flight controller boards.
This is the frame that I took most pride in designing as it took all of my knowledge and feature library to build.  I also asked the designer of The Kwad if it was alright to use a lot of it's features.  With the arm design, low hardware count, and FPV CCD camera mount style this truly made this design what it was.
